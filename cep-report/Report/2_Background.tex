\section{Complex Event Processing}
Complex Event Processing (CEP) ``is a defined set of tools and techniques for analyzing and controlling the complex series of interrelated events that drive modern distributed information systems.`` \citep{NpForMasses}. The Event Processing paradigm sees the world as a series of discrete events with the (producers) sources and sinks (consumers) of the events decoupled in space and time. In modern day distributed systems, events are delivered from sources to the sinks via an Infrastructure of distributed processors, which coordinate to provide processing and routing services. In such an Event based system, the sources and sinks may span a wide geographical area, connected by a CEP middleware, as described in \cite{Cugola}. The CEP middleware detects primitive events based on described patterns, interprets and combines them to identify higher level composite events. A CEP middleware, thus can be said to be comprised of three key components: a) Rules Engine, responsible for expressing rules used by the compute node  b) Compute Node, responsible for detecting primitive event patterns and interpreting them to generate complex events based on the rules c) Notification Service, responsible for notifying the event sinks about the occurrence of events.

Network Virtualization combined with Software Defined Networking presents Network operators with immense opportunities to monetize their infrastructure. Out of this opportunity emerges what is referred to as the Software-defined virtualized networking(SVN) market, allowing operators to move otherwise specialized-hardware functions into the virtualized software environment, thereby creating a model of provisioning network services on demand without having to invest in expensive, specialized Hardware which come with a risk of vendor lock-in. \cite{PerAnalysisNFV}

For example, in a Trade Analysis scenario, an Analyst may require the CEP engine to notify if there is a 'SHORT' transaction for a stock with CUSIP ID '1234' with a value of less than '102'. Needless to say even with a simple rule a CEP engine has to process enormous amounts of data in real-time.
